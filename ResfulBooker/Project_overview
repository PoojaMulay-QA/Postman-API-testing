The Restful Booker API is a hotel reservation system that allows users to intract with Diffrent EntPoints to Retrive,update & delete bookings.
The Project will include a wide range of test scenerios, including Postive & negative test cases, To cover All aspects of Restful Booker API

Objective 
The objective of this test plan is to basically verify the RESTful Booker API, where we have created booking, updated booking, 
delete booking with authentication, add authentication token. It basically contains a lot of bugs also. We need to find all those bugs. 
That's the overall objective. We are going to put them all into a Postman for test case execution. And in the end, 
we need automation also for the same by using REST assured framework.
